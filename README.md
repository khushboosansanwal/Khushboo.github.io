Work Experience

PYTHON FOR DATA SCIENCE AND MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP (2023)

Data Science & Programming: Advanced Python proficiency, including NumPy and pandas for efficient data manipulation, along with handling Excel files, web scraping, and connecting Python to SQL databases.
Data Visualisation & Machine Learning: Practical experience in data visualisation with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, creating both static and interactive visualisations. Machine learning using SciKit Learn, covering techniques like Linear Regression, K Nearest Neighbours, K Means Clustering, Decision Trees, and Random Forests for data- driven insights and problem-solving.
Data Scientist @ NFQ, London (June 2020 - 2021)

Collaborated closely with the Data Science team to incorporate real stock data into the pricing model, bridging theory with practical application and engaged in regular knowledge-sharing sessions with team members, fostering an environment of continuous learning and skill development.
Defended the chosen mathematical approaches through rigorous testing, sensitivity analysis, and validation. Communicated the findings to stakeholders, building trust in the model's capabilities.
Successfully managed the project under tight deadlines, overcoming challenges of working with real-world data, and delivering an accurate and user-friendly Pricer. Key achievements: Created an interactive option pricing model that was successfully put in production and sold to Tier 1 Investment Bank clients. The project was well received by senior stakeholders of the firm and gained additional funding for the Data Science Team.
Consultant, Advisory @ SANTANDER VIA NFQ, LONDON(2019 - 2020)

Resolved complex technical, strategic, and business-related issues; Provided strategic guidance in navigating business-related issues, such as market volatility, regulatory changes, and competitive pressures. Key Achievement: Saved the client £9M by discovering certain types of trades that were heavily penalised by the new regulation, therefore helping the business change their strategy.
ASSOCIATE, ADVISORY @ SANTANDER VIA NFQ, LONDON(2018 - 2019)

Projects

Project 1) Credit Model: Loan Predictions through Advanced Feature Engineering and TensorFlow

Using the TensorFlow algorithm to decide whether or not to lend a customer a loan based on the Lending Club data set. This involved data cleaning, feature engineering and successfully implementing TensorFlow algorithm to fit the data. Shown below are some of the visuals from the project; count plots with a colour gradient to visualise the credit quality of the population in question, scatter plots to explore the relationship between variables of interest, heatmaps helped to visual the correlation between the continuous variables in our data and performance graphs to evaluate the model.

Project 2) Unraveling King County, USA House Prices: Deep Learning Regression with TensorFlow

This project delves into regression problems and the techniques of deep learning. Using TensorFlow, I predicted house prices in King County, USA, unravelling the intricacies of real estate valuation and challenges of creating a ML model for predictions. Some of the EDA that is included delves into heatmaps in relation to house prices, insights from the distribution of house prices using histograms, geographical data analysis and regression plots to visual the predictions of the model.

Project 3) Yelp Review Stars: Easy NLP Classification with Pipelines

This project focuses on classifying reviews into 1 or 5 stars, using streamlined pipeline methods to uncover the straightforward yet impactful magic of NLP in deciphering text sentiment. Some of the EDA that helped form features is shown below, for example visualsing how the text length varies across the 5 different types of rating, boxplots for visualising the outliers in the data set, and the correlation heatmap to explore strong positively and negatively correlated variables.

Project 4) The Black-Scholes-Merton Financial Model

This is an Interactive App with the goal to give an understanding of option-pricing through a hands-on approach using real world data. Throughout the App you will find widgets that allow you to vary the inputs of the Black-Scholes-Merton model and graphical representations of the outputs of the model. In an effort to see the impact of the chosen variations, towards the end of the notebook, you will find a qualitative explanation of the outputs (Greeks) of the underlying model.
