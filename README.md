## Work Experience
**Tesco PLC                                (_Sep 2020 - Present_)**
**Data Scientist**
-Built Tesco’s first productivity model calculating workload from forecasted data which had an accuracy of 97% to actual workload. Led the planning and execution of the Forecasting Cash Sales Project as part of driving the data strategy for the operations team. Built the results and analysis in tableau to share the impact and capital/workload allocation structures (Time Series Analysis, Regression Modelling, Python,SAS,Tableau)

-Modelled, developed, and implemented ETL staging, data validation & data integrity checks and analysis of big data to satisfy business and technical requirements (Hadoop,SparkSQL,Teradata,SQL server)

-Led the design, build and testing of the New stores Clustering Project which gives stakeholders a workload and operational cost estimate for any new stores opening within the Tesco Retail. (Python, Tkinter GUI)

-Built forecasting models (Delivery volume based workload forecasts, Cash vs card sales forecasts, Label Change forecasts) within Operations Development to improve accuracy in workload models (Regression analysis, KMeans, FBProphet) 

-Built Simulation and what-if scenario models(Cases to Fill Travel,Urban Fulfillment Centres, Distribution Centres) to provide business with credible data insights about workload management and Operational Optimisation that can be translated into business improvements (Time Series Modelling, Clustering, Regression, Hadoop, Spark).

-Built Tableau dashboards to analyse performance of Workload Management models’ and presented their results and findings to key stakeholders within Operations Development


**Associate Product Manager**
-Collaborated with stakeholders and product owners to bring their Machine Learning/Analytics requirements through life cycle to the implementation phase (Python,Tableau,Hive,SparkSQL).

-Accountable for running a series of models which inform both finance and stores on the required hours and ultimately cost to complete the activities that are required to fulfil the customer journey. 

-Built tools that speeds up and simplifies BAU/change processes, making it more efficient to reflect change. Understand where there’s a gap in reporting and built Tableau dashboards to simplify it
Skills: Data Strategy,Project Planning, Public Speaking
